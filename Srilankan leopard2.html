            Though the Sri Lanka leopard is classified as endangered,
            leopards can be more easily observed in Sri Lanka than in
            any other Asian country. One reason is: leopards  tend to
            be more hiding due to the existence of larger preditors.
            But there are neither tigers nor lions in Sri Lanka that 
            could frighten leopards.<br>
            Visitors of Sri Lanka taking part in a safari in Yala or Wilpattu
            should be aware, that watching leopards differs from elephant safaris. 
            Observers have to stay at a distance in order to gain some 
            trust of the animal. The most important advice is: to be quiet.<br>

        <div class="page2">

            Yala National Park, block 1 in particular, is most famous for 
            its leopard population and frequented by large numbers of tourists
            seeking to spot the beautiful big cat. Leopards love to lie in
            branch forks and on boulders looking for prey or just relaxing.
            There are many more rocks and open plains in Yala than in Wilpattu.<br>
            As a result, the range of visibility is higher. 
            This is the reason why chances to spot leopards are better in Yala 
            than in Wilpattu, although there might well be even more leopards 
            in Wilpattu. Nonetheless, you should be aware: On a normal 
            Yala half-day safari - about four hours in the morning or
            afternoon - chances to sight a leopard are below 50 percent.
            But a full day in Yala combined with another half-day safari 
            will increase the chances to more than 90 percent.<br>

            <b>On your request, we can provide safari specialists who know 
            some undisturbed areas in Yala that are as much or 
            even more densely populated by leopards than the area of block 1, 
            which is the part of Yala most frequented by safari jeeps.<br></b>

            <b>Size of Sri Lanka leopards<br>
            The Sri Lanka leopard is a comparatively large subspecies.
            Presumably, this is just due to the fact that there are no 
            competing big cats that are more dominant, as tigers or lions 
            are absent from the island. In general, Sri Lankan leopards (Panthera pardus kotiya)
            are larger in size than their relatives in India, though not as big as 
            some Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor).</b>

            <h3><b>The use of leopard Skin</h3></b>
            <img src="Images/leopardskin.jpeg" alt="leopardskin">

            <b>Description</b>:Leopards are roaming Sri Lanka because their habitat has been 
            destroyed and they must search for food in villages.
            In 2020, 13 leopards were reported killed in the island nation,
            mostly in Nuwara Eliya district. The leopards enter villages
            and kill domestic dogs and even cats.<br>

            <b>Consequnces</b>:The leopards are killed to obtain their skin,
            teeth and other body parts. Modern marketing myths have given
            mystical value to the body parts of the leopards.
            People wear leopard teeth around their neck as
            they believe that the teeth of the big cat 
            offer protection, while businessmen keep leopard teeth 
            in a golden bowl to protect their lives and make more money.<br>

            <b>What mechanisms are used to reduce the threats:</b>Under the Fauna and Flora Ordinance,
            the leopard is a protected animal. Killing a leopard is an offense for which 
            a person can be apprehended without a warrant and carries a fine 
            of 30,000 rupees (US$160) to 100,000 rupees or imprisonment for two to five years, or both.
            A Catholic nun who teaches at a school in the Archdiocese of Colombo
            said the animals have not yet come to her village.
            People have gone to the jungle to cut down trees and carry out development activities.<br>

            <h3><b>Destruction of habitat</b></h3>
            <img src="Images/leopardhabitat.jpeg" alt="oneleopard">
            <b>Description:</b>The greatest threat to the leopard, however,
            is unplanned development and illegal encroachment into its natural habitat.
            While Sri Lanka needs development, it must be planned, sustainable
            and take into account the wilderness and wildlife that may already be living in these areas.<br>

            <b>Consequnces:</b>The first to migrate towards people
             are the leopard’s prey species, drawn by the nutritious cultivations 
             and having little left in the areas they are now confined in.
            They become the prime targets for the snares and traps as the
            local human populace hunts their number. The leopards are inevitably 
            drawn into following them and then discover domestic animals
            whose weakened survival instincts make them easier prey 
            than their wilier wild cousins. And so the conflict between human and leopard begins.<br>

            <b>What mechanisms are used to reduce the threat:</b>In 2021, the WNPS and LOLC launched the country’s
            first Multi-Regional Monitoring System for the Conservation of the Sri Lanka Leopard.
            This five year programme, funded by the LOLC, involves:<br>

            1.The establishment of a network of specialised 
            Leopard Conservation Locations and Research Centres across 
            identified geographically important areas<br>

            2.These research centres will focus, on a regional basis,
            on understanding the species function in populations or meta-populations
            that exist at much larger scales than individual management units<br>
