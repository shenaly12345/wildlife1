        <p>
            Towards the end of 1940â€™s, the Government realized the necessity to establish
            a separate Department to enforce the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance 
            and to manage the increasing number of wildlife reserves in the country.
            Accordingly, the Wildlife Department was established in October 1949.
            Conservator of Forests continued as the Acting Warden, until the
            new Wildlife Warden, Mr. C.W. Nicolas, was appointed on the 1st of October 1950.<br>

            Within the first decade, cadre of the department was gradually expanded and deployed 
            to protect the wildlife protected areas in the country. New wildlife Protected Areas 
            in the GalOya basin and the Yala Block II also were declared.<br>

            Most significant step taken within this period was the appointment
            of a committee for the protection of the wildlife in 1957.
            Subsequently, recommendations of this committee on wildlife
            protected area development, establishment of new protected areas,
            amendment of Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance with special 
            reference to wild elephants, establishment of corridors, 
            improvement of organisation of Wildlife Department gave rise
            to a notable progress in those fields.<br>

            The challenge in the hands of the Department of Wildlife Conservation 
            from 1960 onwards was to ensure the protection of wildlife resources against 
            the large scale multi-purpose development projects implemented in the country.<br>

            A string of wildlife protected areas was established in the Mahaweli region, 
            with the objective of providing shelter for the wild animal populations, especially the wild elephants,
            displaced due to large scale forest clearings under the accelerated Mahaweli Development Project.
            United States Agency for International Development (USAID) provided financial assistance through
            a special project titled Mahaweli Environmental Project(MEP), for the establishment 
            and development of these protected areas.
