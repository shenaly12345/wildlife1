            <b>In Udawalawe National Park, elephants are everywhere. They roam in herds of up to 30 
            and total up to 600 in the park, which means a visit here is almost guarantee of sightings.
            There are also leopards, crocodiles, water buffalo, deer, and all types of bird species, 
            but it’s the elephant that’s the star of the show here.<br>
            Seeing them roam the plains, dust themselves, tend to their young, eat and drink,
            and simply be wild elephants, is a core memory from Sri Lanka we’ll never forget.
            And that’s what makes a safari in Udawalawe, and indeed Sri Lanka, so damn exciting.
            Just a four-hour drive from the capital, Colombo, and close by the famed southern 
            coast and central highlands, the national park is reminiscent of those far more popular 
            in Africa or India, yet so much more accessible.
            
            Established in 1972, Udawalawe National Park is a great example of Sri Lanka's efforts
            to protect wildlife in an ethical and sustainable way.
            Primarily created to provide a sanctuary for the large population
            of wild elephants that lived in the area, as well as to protect
            the diverse range of flora and fauna found in the park,
            Udawalawe also provides a catchment area for the Udawalawe Reservoir,
            which is an important source of water for the surrounding area.
            Known for its amazing wildlife  and breathtaking landscapes, 
            the park is nestled in the district of Uva, part of the Udawalawe reservoir,
            the largest water body in the dry zone of Sri Lanka, 
            and covers an area of around 31,000 hectares.

            <b>Located between Habarana and Polonnaruwa, the 8,890 hectares of Minneriya National Park features
            the ancient Minneriya Tank. Constructed in an evergreen forest where sambar deer, leopards,
            and elephants roam, this tank was built in 3rd century AD by King Mahasena. During the
            dry season (June to September), this is an incredible place to observe the elephants
            and flocks of birds, such as cormorants and painted storks.<br>
            <b>Climate and vegetation in Minneriya National Park</b><br>

            The park belongs to the dry zone of the country from May to September considered 
            as the dry season. The wet season lasts during the north eastern monsoon from
            October to January. The main habitats of Minneriya are of several types, 
            including low-canopy montane forests, intermediate high-canopy secondary forests, 
            scrublands, abandoned chena lands, grasslands, rocky outcrops, and wetlands.
            Among the 24 species of mammals resident in the park are Elephants, Leopards, Sloth Bear,
            Spotted Deer, Sambar Deer, Wild Buffalo, Wild Pig, Grey Langers, Purple-faced Leaf Monkey,
            three species of Mongoose, Porcupine and Indian Pangolin.
            Minneriya National Park has recorded over 170 species of birds.
            From Migrating waders like Woodsand Piper, Common Sandpiper & Kentish Plovers
            to forest birds like Malabar-pied Hornbills, Rufus Woodpecker the globally 
            endangered Lesser Adjutant and the endemics Sri Lanka Grey Horn-bill, 
            Sri Lanka Green Pigeon, Brown-capped Babbler and Sri Lanka Jungle Fowl are some of the highlights.

            <b>Sinharaja is a Rain Forest and a biodiversity hotspot which is located in south west
            lowland wet zone within Sabaragamu and Southern provinces of Sri Lanka. Sinharaja
            rain forest is the country’s last viable area of primary tropical rain forest.
            It covers an area of 11,000 Ha of primary and secondary forests. This narrow strip
            of rolling site comprises of a series of ridges and valleys. More than 60% of the
            trees are endemic to Sinharaja Forest and many of them are considered rare.<br>

            There is much endemic wildlife, especially birds but the reserve is also home 
            to over 50% of Sri Lanka’s endemic species of butterflies & mammals and also many kinds of insects,
            reptiles and rare amphibians. This is one of the main reasons that UNESCO declared 
            Sinharaja Forest as a UNESCO World Heritage in 1988 under the name of Sinharaja Forest Reserve.
            In 1936 Sinharaja Forest was first recognized as being the only considerable patch of virgin 
            tropical rain forest in the Island.

            <b>Horton Plains is a beautiful, stark world with excellent hikes in the shadows of 
            Sri Lanka’s second- and third-highest mountains, Kirigalpotta (2395m)
            and Totapola (2357m). The ‘plains’ form an undulating plateau over 2000m high,
            covered by wild grasslands and interspersed with patches of thick forest, 
            rocky outcrops, filigree waterfalls and misty lakes. The surprising diversity
            of the landscape is matched by the wide variety of wildlife, although many 
            of the larger animals are very elusive. Birdwatchers will be well rewarded.<br>
            The park is spread over the two highest mountains in the area called Kirigalpotta and Totapola.
            The plateau-like structure along with plains on one end, thick forests and mountains
            on other make the Central Highlands of Sri Lanka. You will find a number of waterfalls,
            lakes, rocky hills and views of the ocean in this part of the country.
            The forest is home to a number of wild animals and birds, however, most large animals
            remain elusive and unapproachable.
